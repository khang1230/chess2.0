        <h4 class="Info"> You begin with two bishops. They are located right next to the king and the queen. You
            will have one bishop that is on the light squares and one bishop on the dark squares. They will always stay
            on the same color square the entire game. The bishop is worth 3 points in a chess game, equivalent to a
            knight. The bishop can move diagonally as many squares as it would like, without jumping over another piece.
            When a bishop moves you will see notation such as Be4. The B represents the bishop and e4 represents the
            square it is moving to. If the bishop is capturing material on e4 then it would be written as Bxe4. At the
            beginning of the game bishops are blocked by pawns, but you usually will be moving your pawns early on. The
            opens up the door for the bishops to get involved in the game. Bishops will be one of the primary pieces you
            will use in the early game to attack your opponent.
