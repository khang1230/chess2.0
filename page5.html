        <h3 class="castleHead">Checkmate</h3>
        <h4 class="Info">
            <p>When a king is attacked, it is called check. A checkmate (also known as "mate") occurs when a king is
                placed in check and has no legal moves to escape. When a checkmate happens, the game ends immediately,
                and the player who delivered the checkmate wins.

        <h3 class="castleHead">Resignation</h3>
        <h4 class="Info">
            <p>Sometimes one of the players believes that he or she will be checkmated soon and resigns instead of
                playing out the game. The opponent then wins the match.

        <h3 class="castleHead">Timeout</h3>
        <h4 class="Info">
            <p>Timeout is a painful way to lose a chess game. It does not matter how much of an advantage you have on
                the board or whether you have checkmate in one move. If you run out of time, you automatically lose the
                game if your opponent has the minimum material required to force a checkmate. If your opponent does not
                have the minimum amount of material for checkmate and you run out of time, the game is a drawâ€”even if
                you were winning.

        <h3 class="castleHead">Stalmate</h3>

        <h3 class="castleHead">Insuffient Material</h3>
        <h4 class="Info2">
            <p>There are cases where one player has more pieces than the opponent toward the end of the game. However,
                that is not always enough to win because some combinations of pieces cannot force checkmate.
