        <hr>
        <h4 class="Info">
            <p>Pawns can usually capture only pieces that are directly and diagonally in front of them on an adjacent
                file. It moves to the captured piece's square and replaces it. With en passant, though, things are a
                little different. This type of capture is the only one in chess where the capturing piece doesn't land
                on the same square as its victim.

                To perform this capture, you must take your opponent's pawn as if it had moved just one square. You move
                your pawn diagonally to an adjacent square, one rank farther from where it had been, on the same file
                where the enemy's pawn is, and remove the opponent's pawn from the board.</p>

            <p class="rules">Here are the Requirements for En Pasant:</p>

            <p>&#x2022; The capturing pawn must have advanced exactly three ranks to perform this move.
            </p>

            <p>&#x2022; The captured pawn must have moved two squares in one move, landing right next to the capturing
                pawn.
            </p>

            <p>&#x2022; The en passant capture must be performed on the turn immediately after the pawn being captured
                moves. If the player does not capture en passant on that turn, they no longer can do it later.
            </p>
