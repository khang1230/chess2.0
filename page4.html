            <p>Chess, as we know it today, was born out of the Indian game chaturanga before the 600s AD. The game
                spread throughout Asia and Europe over the coming centuries, and eventually evolved into what we know as
                chess around the 16th century. One of the first masters of the game was a Spanish priest named Ruy
                Lopez. Although he didn't invent the opening named after him, he analyzed it in a book he published in
                1561. Chess theory was so primitive back then that Lopez advocated the strategy of playing with the sun
                in your opponent's eyes!
