        <h4 class="Info"> The queen is the piece with a crown on top, but no cross. This is the most powerful chess
            piece and combines the moves of both the rook and the bishop. Like the rook, it is considered a major piece
            in chess. The queens begin on the d1 and d8 squares. This should be the same color as the queen. If you see
            the d1 square is a dark square then you need to rotate the board so the d1 square is a light color square.
            Using the queen correctly is one of the most important parts of chess. It is powerful, so you want to use
            it, but if itâ€™s not protected your opponent can capture your queen and generally leads to a quick loss. The
            queen is worth 9 points, which is more than a rook a bishop combined. The queen combines the moves from the
            bishop and rook. It can move any squares in a diagonal direction, or go up, down, and sideways as many
            squares without jumping over another piece. When a queen moves you will generally see the notation as Qh4.
            The Q represents the queen and h4 represents the square the queen is moving to. If the queen is capturing
            material on h4 then it would be notated Qxh4.
