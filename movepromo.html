        <h1 class="header1">Pawn Promotion</h1>
        <hr>
        <h4 class="Info">
            <p>Promoting a pawn is one of the main goals of chess during an endgame. The mere threat of promoting can be
                a significant advantage for the player who is familiar with this strategy. Here is all you need to know
                about pawn promotion. Pawn promotion occurs when a pawn reaches the farthest rank from its original
                squareâ€”the eighth rank for
                White and first rank for Black. When this happens, the player can replace the pawn for a queen, a rook,
                a bishop, or a knight. Most of the time, players promote a pawn to a queen, which is popularly known as
                "queening the pawn." After one player promotes a pawn, the other player has to move (unless they are
                checkmated, of course).
